## Overview

**Mosaic** automates the discovery of AI breakthroughs by aggregating the latest releases from trusted platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and ArXiv. Through advanced data compilation and intelligent agents, it curates personalized digests and interactive visualizations that cater to both technical experts and non-technical users.

---

## Key Features

-   **Real-Time Aggregation**  
    Seamlessly fetch the latest AI tools, models, and research via APIs and smart scraping techniques from multiple trusted sources.

-   **Personalized Digest & Subscription**  
    Enjoy daily or weekly digests, customized to your interests. Receive curated summaries through email or in-app notifications.

-   **Decentralized Discovery Interface**  
    Navigate using a revolutionary decentralized graph interface. Instead of traditional scroll bars, explore nodes that expand into related content through an intelligent similarity search.

-   **Dual-Perspective Content**  
    Toggle between technical and non-technical views for each article and digest, ensuring accessibility without sacrificing depth.

-   **Advanced Scraping Agents**  
    Leverage state-of-the-art tools like Tavily, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to extract and compile data from sources such as GitHub, ArXiv, and Hugging Face.

-   **Automated Data Compilation & Tagging**  
    Intelligent agents compile, categorize, and tag data into coherent, digestible content that aligns with your interests.

-   **Dynamic Diagram & Image Generation**  
    When visual aids are needed, dedicated agents assess and generate high-quality diagrams and images on the fly.

-   **Trending Visualizations & Timeline Views**  
    Explore interactive trend graphs and timelines that map the growth and evolution of AI models and tools over time.

-   **Audio Summarization & Advanced Filters**  
    Access succinct audio summaries and apply robust filtering to pinpoint exactly what you need.

-   **Underlying RAG System**  
    All data is stored as embeddings in a Retrieval Augmented Generation system for lightning-fast, accurate content retrieval.

## Architecture

Mosaic's architecture is designed for scalability and efficiency:

-   **Scraping Agents**: Continuously scan and extract data from multiple trusted sources.
-   **Data Compiler Agent**: Aggregates and structures the gathered data into a coherent digest.
-   **Tag Making Agent**: Automatically categorizes content for streamlined discovery.
-   **Digest Evaluation Agent**: Ensures the quality and relevance of generated digests.
-   **Image Generation Agent**: Produces necessary visual content if absent in the initial digest.
-   **Decentralized Graph Interface**: Provides an innovative way to browse content through dynamic, clickable nodes.
-   **Interactive Visual Components**: Includes trend graphs, timelines, and audio summaries to enhance user experience.

## How It Works

1.  **Data Collection**: Scraping agents pull in the latest AI research, models, and tools from GitHub, ArXiv, Hugging Face, and more.
2.  **Processing & Compilation**: The data compiler organizes this influx of information while the tag making agent categorizes it for easy navigation.
3.  **Digest Creation**: Personalized digests are generated, evaluated, and enhanced with diagrams or images as needed.
4.  **User Interaction**: Explore content via a modern, decentralized interface with dynamic graphs and interactive nodes, switching seamlessly between technical and layman views.
5.  **Visualization & Trends**: Analyze emerging trends and major AI milestones with interactive visual tools and timelines.
